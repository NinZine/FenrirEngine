Prerequisites
=============
SWIG (might not be needed to download manually for your platform)
	http://www.swig.org/download.html

Premake
	http://industriousone.com/premake/download

Perl
Git


Obtain the source code
======================
You have probably already done this.

`git clone http://krohnke.me/git/FenrirEngine.git FenrirEngine'


Mac OS X Installation
=====================
You need to have SWIG 2.0 or later, and premake 4.0 or later installed to begin.
Obtain SWIG from MacPorts, if you don't have MacPorts get it here:
	http://www.macports.org/install.php

SDL 1.2 is also needed.
	http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php


You should have `SDL.framework' in `/Library/Frameworks' preferably.

	1. `sudo port install swig'

	2. `cd FenrirEngine'

	3. `./swig.pl __SDL__'

	4. `premake4 xcode3'

	5. `open projects/FenrirEngine.xcodeproj'. Opens the project in XCode.
	   Build the project with Command+B.

	On OS X, it currently builds a command line application, this is sometimes
	easier to use during development, but of course a bundle should be built or
	handcrafted when ready for release.

	6. `./FenrirEngine sample/asteroids.lua', press `1' to play some asteroids
	   with interpolation problems. It had multiplayer once, maybe you want to
	   play around with that code.

Android
=======

Building on Android requires, Android SDK and Android NDK.

	1. Edit the following files to contain the correct paths:
		`platform/android/paths.prop' (edit NDK_DIR and SDK_DIR)
      	`platform/android/Android.mk' (edit LUA_SOURCE_PATH and PNG_SOURCE_PATH)
    
	2. `./swig.pl __ANDROID__' to build Lua wrapping code for Android.

	3. `android_setup.sh'

    4. `./android.sh' to compile

    5. `android.sh install' to compile and install to running emulator

    To uninstall from running emulator
      `./android.sh uninstall'

IPhone
======

IPhone port in not yet integrated in the Premake4 building pipeline.

	1. `./swig.pl __IPHONE__' to build Lua wrapping code for the IPhone.

	2. `open platform/iphone/ConceptEngine.xcodeproj/' to open XCode with the
	   IPhone specific settings.

	3. `mkdir game'. Create a folder named `game' and put your `main.lua' file
	   in it.
	
	4. Build the project in XCode with Command+B. The `game' folder will be
	   bundled with the project and `main.lua' run automatically.
